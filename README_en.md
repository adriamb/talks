# Blockchain Madrid Talks
[Ir a la versión en español](README.md).

Use this repo to propose or request talks or other activities for the [Madrid Blockchain meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MadridBlockchain/) as GitHub issues, so everyone can chime in on what they'd like to see.

**[Propose or request a talk](https://github.com/BlockchainMadrid/talks/issues/new)**; don't be shy - we're a young meetup so no need to worry about making mistakes or giving/requesting a talk that's already been done!

## Proposing a talk
Got an idea for a talk? Raise an issue with the details and label it with `proposal`, and we'll work with you from there. You can use this [template](https://github.com/BlockchainMadrid/talks/blob/master/PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md) to describe your proposal.

Talks can be anywhere from 5 mins onwards, so don't feel like you need a lot of content in order to talk (if you have more than 30-40 mins, it'd be best to split your content into several talks). We are also happy to review your talk if you'd like that.

## Requesting a talk
Would you like to see a talk on a particular topic? Something you'd like to understand better, or an interesting area?

Raise an issue with the details and label it with `request`, and we'll see if we can organise someone to give that talk :)

## What can you talk about?

First up, there's no need to be an expert of any kind, so don't feel like you have to be in order to talk.

Secondly, you can talk about anything related to public blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, although there's space for researching and discussing other decentralized protocols and P2P networks.
Aside from looking at what other people have requested, here are some ideas:

- Scalability issues of blockchain technology
- Second layer solutions, payment channels, state channels, Lightning Network, etc.
- Sidechains and atomic swaps
- Smart contract development
- Smart contract security
- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
- Decentralized Applications (DApps)
- Usability and UX of blockchain apps and tools
- Basic applied cryptography, hash functions, signature algorithms, etc.
- Advanced applied cryptography, Schnorr, homomorphism, VRFs, etc.
- Peering protocols
- Consensus protocols
- Governance of decentralized protocols and networks 
- Oracles
- Prediction markets
- Stablecoins
- The future of Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.
